Language extensions
===================

Many (right now all) of these won't export anything to Go, and should be
included using "_".

e.g.

	import _ "github.com/bobappleyard/ts/ext"

That package there is actually a package that includes all the extensions. If
you want to control which packages are available to the runtime, use the same
method but on individual extensions.

e.g.

	import _ "github.com/bobappleyard/ts/ext/web"

This only uses the web extension to the language.
